    <p>Ayn Rand's principles presented a more glorious and utopian world. She believed in the idea that individuals can accomplish anything they want, take pride in what they want if they were free to do so without the regulations of traditional government. She believed a self-ordering society would be one in which the sources of political control didn't exist, and a society in which technology could turn everyone into heroic individuals. Political controls were no longer needed, but computer networks could create order in society without central control.</p>

    <p>The Californian Ideology was based on radical individualism in which people would be linked by computers and in some way would create their own kind of order. This utter freedom in society was believed to give people the opportunity to build and reshape society in its new interconnected form. It would become a new kind of democracy in which everyone is free to strive for their desires, and accomplish what they want in their lives all while still maintaining a stable society.</p>

    <p>The idea of Objectivism influences technology with the notion that humans can live out their desires, dreams and seek after their own happiness without regard for political control and religion. It is directly related to the concept of the cybernetic theory or feedback loop in which systems of communication and control are ultimately seen as self-regulating.</p>
