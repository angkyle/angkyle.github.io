    <p>The idea of cybernetics as a way in which all life forms naturally find homeostasis, or maintain a kind of equilibrium over time was developed by Tansley's view of the natural world. This notion of the inevitable conclusion of homeostasis relates to System Dynamics in which building models of feedback loops help predict behaviors of these systems. While this is an assumption made regarding "all life forms" - it is argued that it isn't effective in the context of human society. Creating societies in which there is no hierarchy result in members in which still differ in their extend of freedom and therefore lead to ultimate collapse. I can see this influencing the culture of AI and idea of cyborgs, and transhumanism in which animals/humans and machine blur the lines in their divide.</p>

    <p>Applying cybernetics to understand humans can be an interesting perspective. I can see how this overlap of views can provide some possible insights into why humans do the things they do and how they make their decisions. Since cybernetics is so much about the idea of control and communication, it makes sense that it can be used to further understand how humans interact with one another to ensure a functioning society. So much of society's issues and foundation come from this constant regulation and fight for power and control.</p>
