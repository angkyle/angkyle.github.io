    <p>When thinking about materiality maniefested in poor image, it becomes a matter of how commodity and economics are affected in society as well. This idea of the image going through the process of being, "compressed, reproduced, ripped, remixed, as well as copied and pasted into other channels of distribution" represent the way it undergoes wear and tear similar to the way any tangible object might. The image being reformatted, reuploaded and continuously shared is argued to lose its value and original quality. Images created or possessed by those who brought it into visual reality lose their hold just as one might with an object, as it is continously passed down like a part of hand-me-down shirt. The idea that "Poor images are thus popular images—images that can be made and seen by the many" demonstrate its value regardless of whether it is considered objectively "low quality." The sentiment behind the image and the way it accumulates meaning as it is interpreted and shared by more and more people inevitably add to its more subjective meaning—similar to the way inherited possessions are passed along the family—whether it be a worn watch, ragged t-shirt, or faded photo, it may not hold meaning to others, but throughout that family in which they understand its meaning, it is cherished.</p>

    <p>A lot of the politics related to the poor image relates to its symbolic representation of what Steyerl describes as "a snapshot of the affective condition of the crowd, its neurosis, paranoia, and fear, as well as its craving for intensity, fun, and distraction." The way the image has played a part in digital communication influences the way it "constructs anonymous global networks just as it creates a shared history." The way image travels inherently causes it to gain new meanings, and provoke new perspectives. It risks being translated incorrectly, and creates new avenues of discourse. And Steyerl explains that this meaning is now based on the "transience of the copy" rather than the original image itself. The idea of "visual bonds" speak to the way images link people throughout the world with eachother. Audiences from around the world now share a mutual excitement, or fear as these poor images circulate and communicate, while potentially influencing the political climate of one's nation as well.</p>

    <p>The topic of speed relates directly with the poor image in that as an image loses quality, it gains speed. With less quality, an image is easier compressed, uploaded, shared with others. It is in its accessibility that it is effective as it loses resolution and matter. As Steyerl explains, "Poor images are poor because they are heavily compressed and travel quickly. They lose matter and gain speed." This dematerialization represents the way data has become flexible, and in a way, more than ever being accessible and able to be combined into newer permutations that seem incalculable.</p>
