You reach near the end.
<br><br>
A hovering crystal with a face appears.
<br><br>
<i>"I am Keeper of the Liminal Worlds.
  <br>Are you sure you want to go home, human?"</i> The face asks.
<br> You can't speak. You nod instead.<br>
<br><i>"It seems you have been through a lot. Though, your heart feels empty."</i>
<br> The voice continues, <i>"I will let you home. You've survived Liminal Chaos.
  <br>However, with a heart of shame and a mind haunted with regret, <br>you can only live with so much meaning."</i>
<br><br>
There is some silence.
<br><br>
<i>"I wish you peace when time comes to take your life, human."</i>
