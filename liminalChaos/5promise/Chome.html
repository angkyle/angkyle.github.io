You reach near the end.
<br><br>
A face appears.
<br><br>
<i>"I am Keeper of the Liminal Worlds.
  <br>Are you sure you want to go home, human?"</i> The face asks.
<br> You answer bittersweetly.<br>
<br><i>"It seems you have been through a lot. Your heart feels full,
  and you've done well in Liminal Chaos.
  <br>With a mind of fortitude, and a spirit of rich emotion, I sense within you a meaningful life lived."</i>

<br><br>There is some silence.
<br><br>
The face summons the portal to the archway.
<br><br>
<i>"I wish you peace when time comes to take your life, human."</i>
