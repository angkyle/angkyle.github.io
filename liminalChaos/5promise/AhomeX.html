The journey takes longer than you expected.
<br>Your wounds from the acid have started to heal the more you clench the orb.
<br>But your body still aches from pain.
<br><br>
It is early morning by the time you reach the lake.
<br>As you dip the orb in the water, a bridge appears.
<br><br>It leads to the archway.

<br><br>
You put the orb back in your bag, and <a href="../5promise/BhomeX.html"><i><b>cross the bridge</b></i></a>.
