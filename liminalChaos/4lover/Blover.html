Another month passes. While things here are not so bad, you still want to get back home.
You feel safe in the tribe trusting you enough to want to help. <br><br>You talk to Maspien.
<br><br>

<i>"The only way for you to get back is to find the orb to summon the archway portal.
Brenil knows more about it, as they've been cur---"</i>
  <br><br>
Brenil walks in and Maspien swallows their words.
  <br><br>
  <i>"What's wrong?"</i> Brenil asks.
<br><br>
Maspien continues, "I will leave you two to talk."
<br>Turning to you, Maspien nods as they leave the hut, "I wish you good luck."
