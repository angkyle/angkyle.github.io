You rush back to the cave as fast as you can. You can hear Brenil's screams.
<br>You search in the glowing cave, but you can't find the orb. It seems to be empty.
<br><br>
<i>"You're trying to open the archway back to the human world, aren't you?"</i>
<br>You hear a voice echoing within the cave.
<br><br>
"Who are you?"
<br><br>
<i>"I can help you... and your little friend. I have the orb you are looking for."</i>
<br>The voice hisses in the dark.
<br><br> <i>"All I need for you to do is to show me where your tribe resides.
  <br>After, I will give you the orb and help your friend out of their curse."</i>
