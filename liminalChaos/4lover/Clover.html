You two sit by the pink lake together. <br><br>
Brenil explains, <i>"For you to get home, you need to retrieve the orb from the cave past the light in the forest."</i>
<br><br>
<i>"How do I get there?"</i>
<br><br>
Brenil hesitates, but you see in their eyes they have no choice but to tell you.
<br><br>
<i>"Our people are not allowed to cross that archway to where you humans live. We are stuck in this liminal land with no way to leave.
<br>My father was human, and my mother was born in our tribe. I am cursed with blood that attracts the beasts. <br>
If I try to even go near the forest's light, I fall into a deep disease and the beasts will swarm the land around me. <br>I've tried before many years ago.
Only humans or those with human blood can see the light, so the others won't know how to help you."</i>

<br><br>
There is <a href="Dlover.html"><i>silence</i></a> between you.
