Alkura rushes over to you and Brenil.
<br>Brenil is unconscious.
<br><br>
<i>"What happened?! Human, what did you do?"</i>
<br><br>
<i>"Brenil helped me find the orb to open the archway. I talked to another fellow in the cave.
  <br><br>They told me they would visit your tribe as they gave me the orb and healed Brenil from the curse.
They protected us from the beasts."
  <br>Brenil
  <br>
  You explain as Alkura and Maspien grow wide-eyed.
  <br><br>

  Maspien solemnly looks at you. <i>"Human. Tell me now you did not give away our tribe's location."</i>
