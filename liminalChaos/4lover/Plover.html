<p>
You and Brenil return to the tribe.
<br><br>You give Brenil one of the spheres.
<br>The tribe visit your hut as you pack your things.
<br><br>
<i>"Thank you for helping our tribe rid of the curse.
<br>I knew it would do both us good when I thought to help you escape that beast.
<br>To summon the bridge, just dip the orb into the pink lake. You'll know what to do."</i>
<br>Mespian gives you a friendly pat on the back.
<br><br>
<i>Alkura smiles and thanks you as well.</i>
<br><br>
"I guess, I'll have to visit you one of these days." Brelin smiles.


<br><br>
You smile back and <a href="../5promise/Ahome.html"><i><b>give them a long embrace</b></i></a>.
