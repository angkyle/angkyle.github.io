After a few more days, Brenil seems to have completely recovered.
<br><br>
<i>"We're going back to the cave. I will help you get home."</i>
<br><br>You express concern.
<br><i>"I know it sounds crazy, but it's the least I can do after all you've done for me."</i>


<br><br>
You head out together in the morning.
<br>

<br>just in case you and Brenil need assistance.<br>
<br>

<br><br><br>
