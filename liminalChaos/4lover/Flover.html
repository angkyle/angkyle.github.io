Just as you reach the glowing cave, you hear an agonizing scream.
<br>You rush back to where Brenil stood to find them drowning in a pool of acidic fluid.
<br> A beast snaps at them from a tree nearby, inching closer and closer.
<br><br>
<i>"Please... save yourself. There's no use. You will burn with me.
  <br>Or the beast will devour both of us.
  <br>
  <br>Get the orb and go home. Tell my tribe I've done my best."</i>
<br>Brenil screams, gurgling under the sizzle of acid burning their skin.


<br><br><br>
