You hear Alkura screaming Brenil's name. You rush out the hut with your belongings.
<br> The tribe members gather around and you hear an overwhelming mass of wailing.
<br><br>
Teary eyed, Maspien whispers to you, <i>"It seems the deal you've made was all part of Gastraka's plan.
  <br>Leave now before Alkura kills you. Head out south from where we first met.
  <br>Soak the orb in the pink lake and the archway bridge will appear. Goodbye human."</i>
  <br><br>

You run to the lake in the night as you hear Brenil's words echo in your head, <a href="../5promise/AhomeX.html"><i><b>"Please... save yourself."</b></i></a>
