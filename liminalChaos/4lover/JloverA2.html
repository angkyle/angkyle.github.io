  Another week passes.<br>
   Brenil seems to have gained some mobility back in their arms.
  <br> But they still can't walk.
  <br><br>
  There were more than a few nights when screams of pain can be heard from their hut
  <br>as the caretaking tribe member changes their bandages.
  <br><br>
  You walk in to visit them.
  <br><br>
  <i>"I don't know how much longer I can deal with this pain."</i> Brenil confesses.
  <br><i>"Sometimes, I'd rather die than endure another day."</i>
  <br><br>
  You ask if you can help in any way.
  <br><br>
  <i>"Just be with me."</i>


<br><br>
You sit beside them, and <a href="Klover.html"><i><b>hold their hand</b></i></a>.
