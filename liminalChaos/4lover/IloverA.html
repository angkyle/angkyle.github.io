You wake up in a hut, completely bandaged.
<br><br>
Maspien comes up to you. <i>"You're finally awake. It's been days. Brenil is awake, but they can't move at all.
  <br>Your wounds seem to be healing quicker than theirs. The burns on Brenil are quite deep."</i><br><br>
  Alkura walks in.
  <br><br>
  <i>"Brenil told me what happened. You have grown in great skill in defeating that beast.
    <br>Thank you for saving Brenil. We are indebted to your noble deed."</i>

<br><br>
You smile at Alkura as he leaves, right before <a href="JloverA.html"><i><b>closing your eyes</b></i></a> to rest.
