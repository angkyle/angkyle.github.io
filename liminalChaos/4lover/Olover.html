  You approach the glow of the cave.<br>
  Brelin stands close to you but awaits by the entrance to look out for potential beasts.
  <br><br>
  You hear a voice and it echoes, <i>"Human, you long to go back to where you are from?"</i>
  <br>You answer back. The voice feels closer this time.
  <br><br>
  <i>"I sense a full heart in you. You are beyond the liminality of this realm.
    Here is the orb you seek."</i>
    <br><br>
    A hand lingers in front of you. You take the orb.
    <br><br><i>"If you care to free your friend from their curse, give them one of the accompanying floating spheres.
      <br>As half human, they have the unique ability to cross between realms. However, if you go forth, you may no longer return to this land."</i>
<br><br>
The voice disappears.
<br>It is getting dark.

<br><br>
You and Brenil <a href="Plover.html"><i><b>return to the tribe</b></i></a>.
