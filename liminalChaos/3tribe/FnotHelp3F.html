  <i>"Stay here. If you don't want me to take your blood, <br>
    I'll have to kill those predators myself and come back for you."</i>
  <br>The faceless human leaves.
  <br><br>
  It gets dark. The faceless human comes back with blood all over their arms.
  <br>
  <i>"Let's go. We have to go now."</i> They say urgently.
  <br>You run with them through the night.
  <br>With every step, you weaken, and by the moon's peak hour, you black out.
  <br><br>
  You feel the faceless human nudging you awake,<br> but your body <a href="../1survive/3choosingLoop.html"><i><b>gives in</b></i></a>.
