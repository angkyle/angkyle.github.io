  <i>"Stay here. If you do not want me to take your blood, I will have to kill those predators myself and come back for you."</i>
  <br>The faceless human leaves.
  <br><br>
  It gets dark. The faceless human comes back with blood all over their arms.
  <br>
  <i>"Let's go. We have to go now."</i> They say urgently.
  You run with them through the night. With every step, you weaken, and by the moon's peak hour, you black out.
  <br><br>
  You feel the faceless human nudging you, but your body gives in.
  <br>After drifting in and out of consciousness, you're on the ground by a lake.
