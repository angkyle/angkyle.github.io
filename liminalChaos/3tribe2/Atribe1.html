Across the lake, you see the other faceless humans.

<br><br>
The faceless human talks to them, you hear,<br>
<br> <i>"The human needs to get back home. <br>They're wounded and were attacked by one of predators. <br>
  They lurk more and more these days."</i>
<br><br>

<i>"What makes you think we can trust this human after what happened?"</i>
<br>One of them ask.
<br><br>
They continue to whisper and negotiate a plan.
<br>
After a while, the faceless human comes back to <a href="Btribe1.html"><i>introduces you </i></a>to them.
