  You hear the screeching of other creatures echoing through the forest.
  <br> The others have already seized prey.
  <br><br>
  <i>"Watch out. There's something there."</i> One of the members nudge you.
  <br>You grip tighter onto the blade Maspien gave you.
  <br><br>
  A wolf leaps out of the dark and in front of you.
  <br> The tribe circles around you. Maspien stands nearby. <br>He seems just as ready to charge as the others.
    <br><br> The wolf growls menacingly––it's about to pounce.
  <br><br>

  <br>
    - <a href="E1kill.html">Charge straight ahead.</a>
