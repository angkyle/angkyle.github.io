      <p> You take a bite––the crunch, the flavor fill your senses with delight. You hear rustling among the bushes but assume it's another critter.
        You continue to walk along the forest, looking for a river to quench your thirst.
        <br><br>
        You feel an aching sting.
        A bleeding rash has spread throughout your entire forearm.
        <br>
        <i>"Shit."</i> You're taken aback.
<br>
        <br>You hurry to go <i><a href="C2creature.html"> find a river</a></i>, hoping you can clean your wound.
