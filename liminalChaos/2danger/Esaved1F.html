    The faceless human stares back at you intently. After some silence, they say––
    <br><br>
    <i>"You are hurt. You must need some rest."</i>
    <br> They continue, <i>"I can help you, but I must ask you to do me a favor. I know you are not from here."</i>
    <br><br>They tell you, <i>"I must get back to my tribe.<b> I need you to give me some more of your blood</b> so I can make what I need to get back."</i>
    <br><br><i>"What do you say?"</i>

    <br><br><br>
  -  <a href="../3tribe/Fhelp1F.html"><b>"Okay, as long as you help me get back home."</b></a>
  <br><br>-  <a href="../3tribe/FnotHelp2F.html"><b>"No way. Can we do something else?"</b></a>
