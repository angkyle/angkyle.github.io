        You keep running despite the pain of the rough terrain against your shoe-less feet. <br>
        Despite your persistence, you lose your footing and trip. The creature comes even closer.
        <br>
        You hear whistling from a nearby tree. <br><br>
        <i>"Hey! Over here! Come on."</i><br> It doesn't sound like a language you know, but you understand them.
        <br> A faceless human-like creature gestures you over to hide in a cave near them.
        <br> Just as the monstrous beast falls inches behind––you get up and miss its grasp by a second.
        <br>
        The faceless human grabs you by the arm and leads you to the cave.
        You <a href="Esaved1F.html"><i>follow them along</i></a>, and both of you nimbly rush through the forest.
