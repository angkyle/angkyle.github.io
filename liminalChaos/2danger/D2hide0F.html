        You're a few inches from the cave, but you start to feel dizzy from losing so much blood.

          <br>As the creature catches up while you slow, an arm reaches out from the cave and pulls you in.
          <br><br>

          The creature growls and hisses at the opening of the cave––only its snout fitting inside.
          <br>It whines in frustration after futile attempts to get in the cave.
          <br> It leaves.
          <br><br>
          You <a href="Esaved0F.html"><i>sigh in relief</i></a>, grasping your arm in pain.
          <br>You turn and see the faceless human who pulled you inside.

        <br>
