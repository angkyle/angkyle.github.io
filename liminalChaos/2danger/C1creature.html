      <p> Just as you fall into a deep sleep, you wake to moisture dripping on your forehead.
        <br><i>"What the--"</i>
<br><br>
      You hold your breath. You feel panic engulf you.
      <br>The creature stands there for a while, hovering over you.
      <br>You reach for one of the fruit you picked––the creature's eyes follow your hand.
      <br><br>You throw the fruit as hard and as far as you can. And with astonishing speed, the creature runs after it.
      <br><br>
