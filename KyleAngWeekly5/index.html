      <p><ul>
        <li>What are the two models of political change that accelerationism wishes to overcome?</li>
        <li>What if anything is the difference between speed and acceleration?</li>
        <li>What do you think is the role of gender in this paradigm?</li>

    <p>Accelerationism advocates for rather than overcoming capitalism, it must be accelerate to achieve any significant social change. This takes a stance of rather than trying to fight against capitalism, it would be more effective to
    intensify it in order for it to inevitably lead to self-destruction. With this self-destruction of capitalism,
  the manifesto states, that "Democracy cannot be defined simply by its means"–whether that is voting, or discussion–the goal is to align its principles with the Elightenment. It promotes the idea of self-actualization, understanding one's self leading to bettering the world.</p>

    <p>Speed and acceleration differ with their relationship to magnitude and direction. From a physics standpoint, speed is a scalar value while acceleration is a vector value. Speed is characterized as distance covered over time, and is pretty much the rate of motion. Acceleration, on the other hand, is the rate of motion <i>and</i> the direction of motion.
    As a vector quantity, the decrease or increase of the object's motion is diretly linked to its direction. Unlike speed, which is more one-dimensional in its quanitty.
  I can see how this is related to the idea of <i>Accelerationism</i> with how the process of intensifying or "accelerating" capitalism is connected to which direction it may influence systems of society to move towards, and in what direction political aspects of society may lean towards.</p>

  <p>With regard to gender, it is obvious that our society functions in a power structure in which men hold power. Men influence others, regulate control, and maintain this control. The long-standing history of men being in the public sphere with autonomy and action as their driving force with what creates a sense of self-worth is inarguably a stark contrast to the way women are expected to and regulated to stay in the domesticated sphere–where they hold no power of their own, and remain dependent on their male significant others. The nuclear family dynamic is a system that enforces this idea of the man being the powerhouse of society–the ones who make decisions, enforce and create laws, and utlimately keep those beneath them or those who are oppressed in their place. There is a possibility for capitalism to definitely collapse through this idea of accelerationism, yet I worry that despite this, it would not solve many of the gender-rooted issues in which power leans heavily towards one group of people, while majority lack it and stay in their position in a regulated hierarchy.</p>
