    <h2><em>"Vaster Than Empires and More Slow"</em> by Ursula Le Guin</h2>

    <h3>Response:</h3>
    <p>I found Ursula Le Guin's style of writing to be amusing and refreshingly distinct. Her description of The Hainish as "tiresomely understanding parents" illustrate an accurate and vivid picture of how she wants her characters perceived. Little details such as Mannon, "gazing mildly at the saliva flecks on Porlock's mustache" brings her characters dimension yet an endearing kind of relatability.</p>

    <p>Further, the exploration of society and humans versus those who are ostracized or outsiders is one that I find strikingly relevant today. The impact of technology connecting us with each other yet sacrificing the humanness in the interactions we could be having face-to-face is directly related to the idea of how The Surveyors would volunteer to engage in a mission that would last centuries. As Le Guin describes the Surveyors as "escapists, misfits, of unsound mind, and nuts," she emphasizes the idea that rather than remaining in human society in which they are perceived and labeled this way, they would rather go off on an incredibly isolated and unknown exploration of other worlds.</p>

    <p>The fact that Osden, as a supernormal empath, is still considered to be an outsider and to be the most, "intolerable" as Porlock would describe him to be, among the Surveyors says a lot about how society has changed through the rapid advancement of technology. Harfex's stubborn insistence of there no existing living beings or animals in World 4470 illustrates the way humans dismiss the unconscious. The questions Tomiko ask Osden are ones that directly touch on the notion of the universal human longing for connection, the fear of the unknown and the power of communication. The fact that Le Guin describes Hanishman with "powerful, over-repressed emotions" speak to the way humans live our lives today - simply venturing out with facades and presenting our inner worlds with layers and layers of filter to hide the reality in which we live.</p>

    <p>The idea of fear being personified is another big idea connected to the way humans live. Many of our systems and power structures would be claimed with the purpose to organize and create order, but in truth, it is the fear of not knowing, the fear of disorder, the fear of how vast the world is, and how our lives may hold very insignificant meaning - if at all.</p>

    <p>Porlock accusing Osden of projecting fear onto the Surveyors is evidence of his own projection of fear. His act of accusing and claiming to have attacked Osden is a mere surrender to his own anxieties. It would be better to claim something - even if it were false - than to linger in the midst of the unknown. With this, I think humanity tends to have a trend in functioning similarly. To accuse, blame, impulsively decide regardless of consequences just to have some kind of certainty even when subconsciously, one might know with great terror that certainty doesn't exist. </p>
